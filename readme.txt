This is a deep steganography project using Python language. It is designed for secure data communication.

Tools Required:
Jupyter Notebook with GPU connection or Google Colab with GPU runtime

Libraries required to be installed:
i.keras
ii.Matplotlib
iii.Numpy
iv.scipy
v.tqdm

Dataset Used:
i.For secret image: https://www.kaggle.com/biancaferreira/african-wildlife
ii.For cover image: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

To access the DNN model, the medical_image_steganography.ipynb files of the project needs be run on any system meeting the above requirements. Each block of notebook can run using run option in interface or shift+enter.

Evaluation metric of the model can be checked by running the evaluation_metric.ipynb

Basic Methodologies Implementation
1. Bpcs method: Open Bpcs folder and one more readme file is provided in order to impement this method.
2. LSB Method: Run LSB_Steganography.ipynb file in any of the system meeting above requirements.
3. DWT method: Open matlab online tool provided in online_tools.doc file and run the dwt.m file
4. DCT Method: Same procedure as DWT should be follwed in order to run DCT method by taking matlab files from folder DCT.
